# Contoso Travel — AI Agent Framework Workshop

A 4-day hands-on workshop that takes developers from zero AI experience to building, deploying, and optimizing a production-grade multi-agent travel platform on Microsoft Foundry using the Microsoft Agent Framework.

## What You'll Build

**Contoso Travel** — an AI-powered trip planning platform with multiple specialized agents:

| Agent | Purpose | Day |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **Destination Advisor** | Recommends travel destinations based on preferences | Day 1 |
| **Trip Planner** | Searches flights/hotels, builds itineraries using tool calling | Day 2 |
| **Local Guide** | Answers questions about destinations using RAG over travel content | Day 3 |
| **Orchestrator** | Routes user requests to the right specialist agent | Day 3 |
| **Production Deployment** | Full system deployed, evaluated, and optimized on Foundry | Day 4 |

## Workshop Schedule

| Day | Theme | Key Concepts |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| [Day 1](docs/day-1/README.md) | **Hello, Agent** | AI fundamentals, Agent Framework, prompt engineering |
| [Day 2](docs/day-2/README.md) | **Make It Useful** | Tool calling, Bing Grounding, structured outputs |
| [Day 3](docs/day-3/README.md) | **Make It Smart** | RAG, multi-agent orchestration, human-in-the-loop |
| [Day 4](docs/day-4/README.md) | **Ship It** | Containerization, Foundry deployment, evaluation, optimization |

## How to Use This Workshop

1. **Read [PREREQUISITES.md](PREREQUISITES.md)** and complete all setup before Day 1
2. **New to Python or cloud?** Read the [Beginner Primer](docs/BEGINNER-PRIMER.md) — it covers virtual environments, `.env` files, HTTP servers, Docker, and other concepts used in the labs
3. **Each day** has its own folder under `docs/` with a README overview and numbered labs
4. **Starter code** in `src/` contains scaffolded files with `# TODO` markers for you to complete
5. **Solutions** in `solutions/` provide complete reference implementations — try before peeking!
6. **Each lab builds on the previous** — complete them in order
